      <p> Makeup artists prepare people to appear at special events by applying makeup that is appropriate for the situation. Generally, they begin by cleansing their clients' skin. They then proceed to choose the ideal makeup style after evaluating their clients' hair color, eye color, and skin tone and type. </p>
